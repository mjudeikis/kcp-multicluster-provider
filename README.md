# kcp-dev/multicluster-provider

This repository contains an **experimental** provider implementation for [multicluster-runtime](https://github.com/multicluster-runtime/multicluster-runtime), a new [controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime) "addon" that allows writing uniform multi-cluster-aware Kubernetes controllers.

## Providers

This repository is planned to contain multiple [`Provider`](https://github.com/multicluster-runtime/multicluster-runtime/blob/223b19b990050e373880d57211c90ce86c53fd80/pkg/multicluster/multicluster.go#L52) implementations depending on how your controllers are supposed to interact with kcp.

Currently available are:

- [virtualworkspace](./virtualworkspace/): for interacting with virtual workspaces like the `APIExport` one.

## Examples

See [examples/apiexport](./examples/apiexport) for sample code.
